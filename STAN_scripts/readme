density2_simplified.stan provides code to calculate a piecewise Pareto fit to DBH data, specifically a two-piece fit. This is because the Pareto distribution tends to only represent the intermediate sizes of forests, and the largest trees and smallest saplings tend not to follow the same distributional shape. We are interested in that middle section, so we allow for STAN to fit the distribution in a piecewise manner so we can excise the largest trees in a statistically defensible manner.

density1_simplified.stan provides similar code, except it estimates a single fit without any piecewise calculations.
